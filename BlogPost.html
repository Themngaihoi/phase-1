    <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Scum Villain’s Self-Saving System is a fantasy cultivation novel written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu.
The story follows Shen Yuan, a modern reader who suddenly dies and transmigrates into a poorly
written web novel as the villain Shen Qingqiu. Unfortunately, this character is destined to die
tragically at the hands of his own disciple.

<h2>Story Concept</h2>

<p>
To survive, Shen Qingqiu must change the plot while obeying rules given by a mysterious
System that punishes him if he acts too differently from the original character.
His attempts to avoid death lead to unexpected emotional bonds and humorous misunderstandings.

<h3>Main Characters</h3>

<p>
The relationship between Shen Qingqiu and Luo Binghe becomes the emotional core of the story.
While Luo Binghe begins as a mistreated disciple, he grows into a powerful figure shaped by
love, betrayal, and obsession.
