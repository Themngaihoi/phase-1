<p>Tteokbokki is a popular Korean street-food dish made from soft, chewy rice cakes cooked in a thick, spicy-sweet red chili sauce. The sauce is usually made with gochujang (fermented chili paste), giving the dish its deep red color and rich, slightly smoky flavor. The rice cakes absorb the sauce while cooking, becoming tender on the outside but pleasantly chewy inside.</p>

<p>It is often prepared with fish cakes, boiled eggs, vegetables like cabbage or onions, and sometimes ramen noodles or melted cheese in modern versions. Tteokbokki is loved for its comforting taste, bold spice level, and satisfying texture, making it one of the most iconic comfort foods and street snacks in South Korea.</p>
